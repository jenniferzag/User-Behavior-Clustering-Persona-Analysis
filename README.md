# User Behavior Clustering & Persona Analysis

This project analyzes user engagement data to uncover behavior patterns and generate data-driven user personas. The goal is to demonstrate how exploratory data analysis and clustering methods can support product research and inclusive design decisions.

## Project Overview

We explore how users engage with a digital platform through:
- Daily usage time
- Login frequency
- Number of pins saved
- Boards created
- Declared interest categories

We apply K-means clustering to identify behavior groups and build basic user personas to better understand audience segments.

## Visual Outputs

### Distribution of Daily Usage Minutes

### User Clusters Based on Engagement Patterns

## Key Learnings

- Clustering helps form personas that reflect real user diversity.
- Visualizing behavior across user types highlights different needs and opportunities.
- Data storytelling bridges quantitative research with empathy-driven design.

## Files

- `user_engagement_data.csv`: Simulated user engagement dataset.
- `clusterAnalysis.Rmd`: R Markdown file with analysis code and visualization.
- `images/`: Folder containing all output figures.

## Tools Used

- R (ggplot2, dplyr, cluster, factoextra)
- Python (for simulation only)

## About

This project is part of a product research preparation portfolio tailored for the Pinterest Apprenticeship application. It reflects an interest in inclusive UX research, curiosity-driven analysis, and storytelling through data.
